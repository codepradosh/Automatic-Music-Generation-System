# Automatic-Music-Generation-System



Generating Irish Folk Tunes and Lyrics - using LSTM¶ This project uses Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) -based recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate music and lyrics using the Irish Folk Music dataset. Additionally, it also generates "Bob Dylan-esque" lyrics, using all of Bob Dylan's songs.



# Summary
We use the power of Deep Learning to train LSTM Networks to creatively generate Irish Folk Tunes and Bob Dylan lyrics

# irish folk music


As a lover of folk tunes, particularly Irish tunes, I found these datasets immensely helpful.

O'Neill's Irish Music dataset (Source: http://trillian.mit.edu/~jc/music/book/oneills/1850/X/ )
Cobb's Irish Music dataset (Source: http://cobb.ece.wisc.edu/irish/Tunebook.html )
Nottingham Music dataset (ABC version of Nottingham music dataset: http://abc.sourceforge.net/NMD/)
I wrote a scraper to scrape O'Neill's and Cobb's data from the sites, clean up the data, and combine them in one file.


# Bob Dylan Songs

I scraped the Bob Dylan songs site (http://bobdylan.com/songs/), downloaded the lyrics separately and combined them in one text file. It comes down a mere 700KB dataset, which is tiny for the purposes of training an RNN.

For copyright reasons, Bob Dylan's lyrics are not included in this repo.

# Char-RNN Based Generator:
The mechanics of the text generation uses a Char-RNN based generator, as decribed by Andrej Karpathy (http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)

To create an RNN, specify the model_type as one 'lstm', 'rnn', or 'gru'. In general, the LSTM type networks have shown to be more effective (per Karpathy)

Specify these params:

batch_size: sequences in a mini batch
sequence_length: number of characters in a sequence
n_cells: number of cells in the (hidden) RNN layers
n_layers: number of layers in the RNN
ckpt_name: unique name for the model; used to save the model or restore from it
learning_rate: how fast or slow the network should learn (typically, 0.001, but can be set to 0.0001)

# ABC Music Format
The ABC Music format is a text-based music format.

Here's one such tune, called Julia Delaney in ABC format: [See a youtube sample here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUZ6zei3fRU]


:174
T:Julia Delaney
Z: id:dc-reel-161
M:C
L:1/8
K:D Minor
A|dcAG F2DF|E2CE F2DF|dcAG F2DF|Add^c defe|!
dcAG F2DF|E2CE F2DF|dcAG F2DF|Add^c d3:|!
e|fede fagf|ecgc acgc|fede fagf|edcA Adde|!
fede fagf|ecgc acgc|fedf edcA|Add^c d3:|!



As can be seen, the format is incredibly compact. Each line begins with a single letter field (except for notes). ABC notation for music (link: http://abcnotation.com/)

X denotes a reference number
M denotes Meter
K denotes the Key
L denotes the beats
T denotes the Title
Z denotes the transcription The rest are notes that denote the melody for the song.
As one can see, this text data is useful to train an RNN to generate a similarly structed .abc, which can then be converted into .MIDI format, and from there to .WAV or .OGG format to play.
